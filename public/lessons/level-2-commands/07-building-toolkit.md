4. **Fixing** - Solve problems
5. **Workflows** - Multi-step processes
6. **Maintenance** - Keep code healthy

### Organization Tips

**Use prefixes:**
- `explore-*` for exploration
- `analyze-*` for analysis
- `gen-*` for generators
- `fix-*` for fixes
- `check-*` for workflows

**Target:** 2-4 commands per category = 12-24 total
